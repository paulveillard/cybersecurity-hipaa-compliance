Enacted by the US Congress in 1996, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides provisions to protect health insurance coverage for workers and their families when they change or lose their jobs. HIPAA requires the establishment of national standards for electronic healthcare transactions and national identifiers for providers, health insurance plans, and employers.
> HIPAA has become a de facto standard for protecting the privacy and security of personally identifiable information (PII) in the healthcare industry.
